  Rules are the base unit in a module and can depend on other rules via either
  source (which depends on the outputs of the rule) or explicit dependencies
  (which just requires that the other rule have been run before).

  Sources can also refer to files, folders, or file globs. When a rule goes to
  run a list of sources will be compiled from the outputs from the previous
  rules as well as all real files on the file system.

  Rules must define a _Context class that extends RuleContext. This context
  will be used when executing the rule to store any temporary state and
  execution progress. Rules should not be modified after their initial
  construction, and instead the _Context should be used.
